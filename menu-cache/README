Libmenu-cache is a library creating and utilizing caches to speed up freedesktop.org application menus.
It can be used as a replacement of libgnome-menu of gnome-menus.

Advantages:
1. Faster loading of menus.
2. Ease of use. (API is very similar to that of libgnome-menu)
3. Lightweight runtime library. (Parsing of the menu definition files 
   are done by menu-cache-gen when the menus are really changed.)
4. Less unnecessary and complicated file monitoring.
5. Greatly reduced disk I/O.

Spec:

Cached menus are localized and stored in ~/.cache/menus/file_name.
file_name is a md5 hash of the name of the original menu + some environment variable + locale name.

Since most data in a menu are plain text (names, comments, icon names,...etc.), the cached file is in 
plain text rather than binary to prevent byte order problems.

Format of the cached menu file, line by line.
(Spaces before the lines are for easier demostration of hierarchy.
 There are no spaces in the real cached file.):

version number (major.minor)
menu name>
number of files to monitor
list of files/dirs which require monitor (prefix D or F indicate whether it's a dir or file)
list of DE names used in this menu other than the known DEs(LXDE, GNOME, XFCE, KDE, ROX), seperated by ;
+id of top menu dir (+ means dir entry, and - means an application entry)
  title
  comment
  icon name
  dir in which menu directory file locates (use this number as index to get the string from array of preceding list of monitored files)
  menu directory file basename
    -application desktop id (FIXME: desktop id is not necessarily the basename of desktop file)
     title
     comment
     icon name
     dir in which the desktop file localtes (use this number as index to get the string from array of preceding list of monitored files)
     app desktop file basename, empty means the same as desktop id.
     generic name
     exec command line
     bitmask flags: (use terminal)|(use startup notification)
     show_in_flags: bitwise or of masks for various DEs.
    +sub dir id
     title
     comment
     icon name
