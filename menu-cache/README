Libmenu-cache is a library creating and utilizing caches to speed up freedesktop.org application menus.
It can be used as a replacement of libgnome-menu of gnome-menus.

Advantages:
1. Faster loading of menus.
2. Ease of use. (API is very similar to that of libgnome-menu)
3. Lightweight runtime library. (Parsing of the menu definition files 
   are done by menu-cache-gen when the menus are really changed.)
4. Less unnecessary and complicated file monitoring.
5. Greatly reduced disk I/O.
