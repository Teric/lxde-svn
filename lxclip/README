lxclip is a small program used to hold the text in the clipboard.
Under X11, the content of clipboard get lost when the owner program
of that data is terminated. This behavior is quite different from 
Windows. So, this little program is used to hold the text data for you.
The clipboard text will still be available even after the owner of 
that data is terminated.
