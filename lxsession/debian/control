Description: a lightweight X11 session manager
 LXSession is a lightweight X11 session manager with fewer dependencies,
 designed for use with the LXDE(Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment).
 It derived from XSM and have following differences:
  * Removed the session dialog from xsm.
  * Use better configuration.
  * Provide a nice logout-dialog with the ability to 
    shutdown/reboot/suspend/hibernate via HAL or gdm,
 and more....
 .
 It's desktop-independent and can be used with any window manager.
 .
 As "session manager" it remembers the applications in use when you 
 logout, and restart the applications when you log back in.
