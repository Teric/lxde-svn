To build this program, you have to install following developing packages:

pkg-config
gtk+ 2.0
xmms2-client
xmms2-client-glib

The last 2 dev packages are provided by xmms2, and will be installed when you install
 xmms2 from tarball.
Since LXMusic is only a GUI frontend, you should have xmms2 in order to use it.
See the official homepage of XMMS2 project <http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/> for detail.

After you get these required packages installed, just type "make", and 
LXMusic will be compiled. Then, type "make install" with root access, and lxmusic
will be installed to /usr/bin.
