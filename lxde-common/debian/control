Description: the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment configuration data
 LXDE (the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) is a new project aimed
 to provide a new desktop environment which is lightweight and fast.
 .
 It's not designed to be powerful and bloated, but to be usable and slim
 enough, and keep the resource usage low.  Different from other desktop 
 environments, lxde don't tightly integrate every component. Instead, 
 lxde tried to make all components independent, and each of them can be 
 used independently with fewer dependencies.
 .
 Features:
  - Lightweight, runs with reasonable memory usage
  - Fast, rund well even on older machines produced in 1999
  - Good-looking, GTK+ 2 internationalized user interface
  - Easy-to-use, the user interface is simple, but usable enough
  - Desktop independent (suprise! Every component can be used without LXDE)
  - Standard compliant, follows the specs on freedesktop.org
  - Suitable for old machines(old Pentium II CPU is enough).
