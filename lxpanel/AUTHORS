History:
LXPanel is a derivative work from fbpanel (http://fbpanel.sourceforge.net/), whose 
author is Anatoly Asviyan, and fbpanel is derived from another project, fspanel 
(http://freshmeat.net/projects/fspanel/), whose author is Peter Zelezny.

Credits:
Fbpanel has done its good job, but it didn't fullfil my needs. Originally I send patches to the 
author of fbpanel, Anatoly Asviyan, and we had some discussion.  After he received some
patches, I found I want to add something to this little panel app which might be differnt
from the goal of Anatoly in the future, and I didn'get enough change to join fbpanel project.
So, finally I decided to create my own branch, and started the hacking I want to do.
Thank Anatoly Asviyan and Peter Zelezny, the original creator for this little panel.
And the most important, thank free software, which gives us the freedom to modify 
existing projects to serve our needs. :-)
