 LXPanel is a lightweight GTK+ 2.x based desktop panel with following

    files on the system.
  * Launcher bar (small icons clicked to launch apps)
  * Task bar supporting urgency hint (can be flash when gaim gets new
    incoming messages)
  * Notification area (system tray)
  * Digital clock
  * Run dialog (a dialog let you type a command and run, can be called
    in external programs)
  * Net status icon plug-in (optional)
  * Volume control plug-in (optional)
  * lxpanelctl, an external controller let you control lxpanel in
